This wine has deep, dark red/black hues, lifted aromas of mulberry, raspberry, coffee and kirsch. The bramble, chocolate, methol and rosemary fl avours that fi ll the mouth are present in abundance, with delicate, sensual and ripe tannins playing a structural role. This wine is ideally suited to good food, good friends and good conversation.\n",

Use of new oak was delicate, so the aromas are authentic Pinot Noir.  \n",
